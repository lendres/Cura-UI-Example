    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    
    <p>
        SurePath allows some input to be specified as command line options.  The user may use any number or combination of the
        options (or switches) to produce the desired effect.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Spaces</h2>
    
	If the arguments to the switches contain spaces, the argument must be enclosed within quotation marks.  For example, paths often
	contains spaces.  As a best practice, always contain paths or other arguments which could potentially contain spaces within 
	double quotes (").  For example, <span class="argument">-project</span> <span class="file-name">"C:\Project 1.stproj"</span>.

    <h2>Switches with Single Arguments and Switches with Multiple Arguments</h2>
    <p>
		Some command line switches are a single input argument and some require multiple arguments.  Binary options (an option is either activated
		or it is not) have only a single input argument.  Other switches, such as those providing a file to load, will require an additional input
		argument which follows the switch.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Available Switches</h2>

    <dl class="argument-list">
        <dt>-project <span class="option">arg</span></dt>
        <dd>
            Specifies that the project file <span class="argument-option">arg</span> should be used.  The name of the input file must include the full path, 
            file name, and extension.
        </dd>

          <dt>-install</dt>
        <dd>
			Specifies that, on start up, the SurePath should initialize certain registry entries.  Existing entries are overwritten.  This is mainly used for testing
			and should not be used by a normal user of the software.
        </dd>
        <dd>
			<span class="warning">
				Warning: This command should only be used by an expert who has the proper knowledge of the consequences that result from using this feature.
			</span>
        </dd>
    </dl>
