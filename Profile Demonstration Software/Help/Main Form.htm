		<tr>
			<td>Toolbars</td>
			<td>
				Toolbars are moveable but revert to their default locations after exiting.
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Interval type selection</td>
			<td>
				Chooses between displaying information for "Formations" or "Sections" interval types.  The Formations and Sections are defined by the user 
				under the <span class="gui-component-name">Project</span> menu.  All charts and graphs are set to the current interval type.

			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Show best values</td>
			<td>
				If checked, an additional line is drawn on the ROP and MSE charts.  It indicates the values from the well with the best ROP for each
				interval.  <span class="warning">Note that because this is calculated on an interval-by-interval basis, the wells the values come from can vary
				between intervals.</span>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>SurePath Drilling Plan</td>
			<td>
				The SurePath Drilling Plan is the recommended starting set points for each interval.  They are calculated on an interval-by-interval basis by comparing
				all wells to find the best ROP for that interval.  The set points associated with the best ROP are shown.  These values are automatically calculated 
				and displayed and cannot be manually changed by the user.  If wells are added or removed, these values are recalculated.
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Baseline and Comparison Well</td>
			<td>
				Controls which wells are shown in the <span class="gui-component-name">Well Comparison Table</span> for the Baseline Well and Comparison Well.  The background color behind each combination box
				corresponds to the background color of the cells in the table that are populated by each control.  These are user defined selections, meaning they can
				be chosen based on which ever criteria the user deems important.
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Types of comparisons</td>
			<td>
				Switches how the wells are compared and the ROP column(s) are highlighted for the Baseline Well and Comparison Well.  The first options compares the second well (Comparison Well, in orange) to the
				first well (Baseline Well, in green).  In this mode, only the Comparison Well's ROP column is highlighted.  The second option compares each well to the 
				SurePath Drilling Plan.  In this option, both well's ROP columns are highlighted.
